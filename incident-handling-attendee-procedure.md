# Attendee Procedure for Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents

**If you believe someone is in physical danger**, consult with a volunteer or staff member for the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number.

If you believe someone has violated the [Indie Hackers Code of Conduct](index.md), we encourage you to report it to the meetup organizer.

In the event of a conflict of interest, you may contact Indie Hackers staff directly:

* Courtland Allen
  * Co-Founder, Indie Hackers
  * [courtland@indiehackers.com](mailto:courtland@indiehackers.com)
* Channing Allen
   * Co-Founder, Indie Hackers
   * [channing@indiehackers.com](mailto:channing@indiehackers.com)

## Report data

If you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Description of the incident
* Date, time, and location of the incident
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Identifying information of the reported person
  * Name or other identifying characteristics such as physical appearance, height, clothing, accent, company name
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

## Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential**. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our meetup attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases, we may determine that the Indie Hackers organization must make a public statement regarding the inceident. If that occurs, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Report-handling procedure

When you make a report to an IH meetup organizer or staff, they will gather information about the incident according to the [Meetup Organizer Procedure For Incident Response](incident-handling-organizer-procedure.md).

After an incident responder takes the report, they will consult with IH central staff (Courtland Allen and Channing Allen) to determine an appropriate resolution.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, the meetup organizer will take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

If the incident is less urgent, IH staff will work with the meetup organizer to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the [IH Organizer Procedure For Incident Response](incident-handling-organizer-procedure.md#possible-incident-resolutions).

## Following up with incident reporters

Within one week of an incident report, IH staff or the meetup organizer will follow up with you (if you provided contact information).

The follow-up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the IH team discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to correct the reported behavior

In some cases, IH staff and organizers may need to ask additional questions about the incident in order to identify the reported person.
